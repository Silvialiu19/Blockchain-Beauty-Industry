# Blockchain-Beauty-Industry
Create a blockchain solution for the beauty industry.

## Current situation
The practitioners of the beauty industry in China are of varying capability. They only need a couple of days of training to start the job. They often cheat about their experience when finding a job. And it’s common for them to leave a beauty salon and go to another one. It’s also common for those store owners to open up another store after one has closed down probably because of bad reputation. It’s insecure and harmful for the whole industry. And it’s reasonable that people can’t trust them.

In order to improve the capability of the practitioners, I plan to use blockchain to create a healthy atmosphere in this industry and to order a better experience to the customers. Based on blockchain, we can create an app to build a traceable data repository of the educational and professional experience of the practitioners and to establish a whole ecosystem for this industry.

I sincerely invite those who see this page to participate this creation and probably help to write a piece of code. I look forward to hear any imaginative ideas and I will be glad to simply become friends with you. Please don’t hesitate to leave a comment if you have anything to share.
